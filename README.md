- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, Text2Emotion for emotional analysis.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Google Cloud to leverage robust and scalable cloud computing.
- **Game Development**: Unity for creating immersive client-side applications.

### 5. Features and Functionality
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage with AI-powered NPCs via text or voice.
- **Intelligent Response Suggestions**: AI generates contextually appropriate responses for users.
- **Realistic Conversations**: Watch NPCs converse with lifelike accuracy.
- **Advanced Animation**: Realistic eye movements and lip-syncing for NPCs.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: NPCs analyze and express emotions through facial expressions.
- **Developer-Friendly SDK**: Easy integration into cross-platform games and web applications.

### 6. Challenges Faced
Throughout the development, integrating real-time speech recognition and ensuring seamless interaction between different AI technologies were significant challenges. Our team overcame these by optimizing AI model responses and enhancing the synchronization between Unity and the backend APIs.

### 7. Accomplishments and Impact
We have successfully developed a versatile SDK that not only enriches user experience through enhanced NPC interactions but also opens up new possibilities for narrative depth in games and interactive applications. Our demo has been exceptionally well-received in user testing, with feedback praising the innovative approach to NPC realism.

### 8. Future Work
Looking forward, we plan to integrate this technology into "Ethernity," our upcoming AI-powered PvPvE shooter game. We aim to develop open-world and dynamic game modes that utilize "Gemini AI Pro," an advanced version of our SDK that allows NPCs to remember players' actions and maintain long-term chat histories, thereby enhancing personalized gameplay experiences.

# 9. SDK Documentation

This is a comprehensive guide for integrating and utilizing the Google AI Avatars SDK. This SDK facilitates the creation of next-gen AI-powered NPCs (non-player characters) for games and web applications, providing realistic interactions through advanced AI technologies.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

Before you begin, you will need to set up your environment to use Google Cloud's AI services. Refer to the following documentation to get started:

- **Generative AI**: [Vertex AI Generative AI Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/)
- **Text-to-Speech**: [Text-to-Speech Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/)
- **Speech-to-Text**: [Speech-to-Text Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and Flask installed.
3. Install necessary Python libraries as mentioned in `requirements.txt`.
4. Set up Google Cloud credentials by following the linked documentation.

## Server-Side Application

The Flask application acts as the backend for the Google AI Avatars SDK. Below are the endpoints provided by the `main.py` script:

### Endpoints

- **POST /generate**: Generates responses based on user input using AI.
  - Input: JSON with 'prompt'
  - Output: AI-generated text based on the prompt

- **POST /synthesize_speech_base64**: Converts text to speech and returns audio in base64 encoding.
  - Input: JSON with 'text'
  - Output: Base64 encoded speech audio

- **POST /synthesize_speech_base64_male**: Similar to the above but uses a male voice.
  - Input: JSON with 'text'
  - Output: Base64 encoded speech audio
