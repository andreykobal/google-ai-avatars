# Google AI Avatars: Revolutionizing NPC Interactions in Gaming and Web Apps

### 1. Project Title
**Google AI Avatars: Next-Gen AI-Powered NPCs**

### 2. Problem Statement
In the gaming and web app industries, NPCs (non-player characters) often lack dynamic interactions, limiting player engagement and immersion. Research indicates that 99% of gamers believe that advanced AI in NPCs could significantly enhance their gaming experience, influencing both their time spent and willingness to pay more for intelligent NPC interactions.

### 3. Solution Overview
**Google AI Avatars** is an SDK designed to integrate cutting-edge AI functionalities with NPCs in games and web apps, providing highly interactive and realistic experiences. This solution is engineered using Unity for the client-side and Google Vertex AI models on the backend to facilitate rich interactions through both text and voice.

#### Modes of Interaction
- **User <> NPC Interaction**:
  - Players can interact with NPCs using text or voice, benefitting from intelligent response suggestions.
  - Interactions are saved within a user-friendly chat UI, reminiscent of modern AI chatbots.

- **NPC <> NPC Interaction**:
  - Two NPCs can autonomously generate dialogues on set topics, mimicking real human conversations, complete with subtitles.

### 4. Technologies Used
- **Vertex AI API**: Utilizes language processing, text-to-speech, and speech recognition.
- **Programming**: Python, Flask.
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, Text2Emotion for emotional analysis.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Google Cloud to leverage robust and scalable cloud computing.
- **Game Development**: Unity for creating immersive client-side applications.

### 5. Features and Functionality
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage with AI-powered NPCs via text or voice.
- **Intelligent Response Suggestions**: AI generates contextually appropriate responses for users.
- **Realistic Conversations**: Watch NPCs converse with lifelike accuracy.
- **Advanced Animation**: Realistic eye movements and lip-syncing for NPCs.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: NPCs analyze and express emotions through facial expressions.
- **Developer-Friendly SDK**: Easy integration into cross-platform games and web applications.

### 6. Challenges Faced
Throughout the development, integrating real-time speech recognition and ensuring seamless interaction between different AI technologies were significant challenges. Our team overcame these by optimizing AI model responses and enhancing the synchronization between Unity and the backend APIs.

### 7. Accomplishments and Impact
We have successfully developed a versatile SDK that not only enriches user experience through enhanced NPC interactions but also opens up new possibilities for narrative depth in games and interactive applications. Our demo has been exceptionally well-received in user testing, with feedback praising the innovative approach to NPC realism.

### 8. Future Work
Looking forward, we plan to integrate this technology into "Ethernity," our upcoming AI-powered PvPvE shooter game. We aim to develop open-world and dynamic game modes that utilize "Gemini AI Pro," an advanced version of our SDK that allows NPCs to remember players' actions and maintain long-term chat histories, thereby enhancing personalized gameplay experiences.
